# Sumo2017
Source code for the 2017 Sumo Robot

Currently, the source code presented in this repository is for Prototype 1 of the robot. The source code is meant to compile for the PIC32 on the chipKIT uC32, using MPLABX. Didn't think about it, but I will include the other MPLABX project files. Also, for those couldn't tell, the majority of the sources present are for the FreeRTOS operating system. Please review main.c to know which sources are user-defined for the application.

At some point, this Readme will be fleshed out.

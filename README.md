# Sumo2017
Source code for the 2017 Sumo Robot

Currently, the source code in this repository's master branch is for Prototype 1 of the robot. However, there will be other branches stemming from the master branch. Each of those branches will represent the source for another prototype. Currently, the branch for Prototpye 2 has been created. 

The source code is meant to compile for the PIC32 on the chipKIT uC32, using MPLABX. Didn't think about it, but I will include the other MPLABX project files. Also, for those couldn't tell, the majority of the sources present are for the FreeRTOS operating system. Please review main.c to know which sources are user-defined for the application.

At some point, this Readme will be fleshed out. At some point.
